firstvar = 1;
secondvar = 2;
repeat (10)
thirdvar = 2 * (firstvar + secondvar)



The first three and a half lines execute exactly as planned. But at the, ) / (, mark of the fourth line, I ran out of time to tweak that to be perfect. Code should work fine for the last 3 lines if the 4th line didnâ€™t shift the tokens in the wrong direction.
