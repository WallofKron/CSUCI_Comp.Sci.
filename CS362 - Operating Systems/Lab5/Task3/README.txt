Along with missing most of the lab on Thursday trying to get a fresh, working copy of Ubuntu on my flash drive, so I could work efficiently from home(Just got flash drive back Monday, still not functional), I also spent much of the weekend working and dealing with my girlfriends transmission on her car giving out Saturday. Spent most of the weekend at car mechanics, and ultimately dealerships trying to get her car fixed/leasing new one. 

Sorry for the story, just trying to explain the lack of efficient code here. I finished this task, but it was poorly planned on my part. It is the most hard-coded thing I’ve ever coded. If I would have had more time to plan out how to implement this more efficiently, it wouldn’t be almost 300 lines of code. But, regardless, it works as intended.
