This task does not function as intended. I started, read through much of the code and spent a few hours learning what everything does. Running out of time to implement anything. I do understand that We are essentially modelling task 1 by implementing the ioctl functions to do what we were doing in task 1. 
Im not making excuses here, but I also would have had more time to implement something in this one if my project hadn't been deleted last week. As I told you(nick) on Thursday, and it still doesn't make sense as to how it was deleted. No one touched my computer between Tuesday and Thursday, but somehow only Project2 is/was gone. I had to start over on Thursday, which set me back about 4 hours or so. Unfortunately.
