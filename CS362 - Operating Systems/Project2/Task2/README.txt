This task Works as its supposed to. I used 40 as the amount of creation events it has, Just to test it. Had alot of successful test runs. Rarely, it did have a seg fault. I also restricted the space it was writing to(noted in the comments), just so there was a much better chance of reading a section that was already written to. And test run that I did for the typescript actually had a few times where it read something that was written to.
