 The logic of the code works out fine. The philosophers act as they should. No errors in compilation either. But it ends up deadlocking after 2 or 3 philosophers finish eating. Which I think has something to do with their respective thread exiting, since that thread is no longer waking the other threads from wait(). I feel as if its some small fix in the logic and it should work correctly.
