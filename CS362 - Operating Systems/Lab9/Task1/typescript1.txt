1). 4096 page size

2). It seems as though, the first page of the file is invalid or has special permissions, the first 4096(first page) bytes are causing the program to segmentation fault.

3). My guess is that the program crashes during the first page, is because that page might have special access privileges. So when we try to access memory we are not allowed to, it segmentation faults.

4). values 4096 to 21067 do not cause a segmentation fault during execution.
